## 👋 Who am I?
🎓 **B.Tech CSE Fresher (India)**  
🧠 Backend-focused | Product-oriented | Problem-first thinker

I don’t build projects to “use tech”.  
I build systems to **solve a specific problem**, then choose tech that fits.

If you’re here to understand **how I think**, you’re in the right place.

## 🧠 How I Think (this is the difference)

- Start with the **problem**, not the framework  
- Prefer **clarity over cleverness**  
- Design systems that can grow, not demos that look good once  
- Use ML only when rules fail  
- Write code that another human can understand  

This mindset reflects across all my projects.
